# Post-Merge Actions Required

After this PR is merged to the `main` branch, follow these steps to complete the GitHub Pages deployment:

## 1. Enable GitHub Pages (One-time Setup)

1. Go to: https://github.com/esejfic/esejfic.github.io/settings/pages
2. Under **"Build and deployment"** section:
   - **Source**: Select **"GitHub Actions"** from the dropdown
   - Click **Save** (if required)

## 2. Verify Workflow Run

1. Go to: https://github.com/esejfic/esejfic.github.io/actions
2. You should see a workflow run for "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Wait for it to complete (green checkmark)
4. Click on the workflow run to see deployment details

## 3. Access Your Site

Once the workflow completes successfully, your site will be available at:
- **Primary URL**: https://esejfic.github.io/
- **Custom Domain**: https://e-chat.me/ (if DNS is configured)

## 4. Configure Custom Domain (If Not Already Done)

If you want to use the custom domain `e-chat.me`:

### DNS Configuration (at your domain registrar):
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.111.153
```

OR use CNAME:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: esejfic.github.io
```

### GitHub Configuration:
1. Go to: https://github.com/esejfic/esejfic.github.io/settings/pages
2. Under **"Custom domain"**: Enter `e-chat.me`
3. Click **Save**
4. Wait for DNS check (may take 5-10 minutes)
5. Once verified, check **"Enforce HTTPS"**

## 5. Testing

After deployment, test the following:
- [ ] Site loads at https://esejfic.github.io/
- [ ] PWA manifest loads correctly
- [ ] Service worker registers
- [ ] Offline mode works (disconnect network, reload page)
- [ ] Firebase integration works (login/authentication)
- [ ] Custom domain (if configured) resolves correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails
- Check the Actions tab for error logs
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled with "GitHub Actions" as source
- Ensure workflow has proper permissions (already configured in deploy.yml)

### 404 Error
- Wait 5-10 minutes after first deployment
- Clear browser cache
- Verify files are present in the repository

### Custom Domain Not Working
- DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours
- Use `dig e-chat.me` to verify DNS records
- Ensure CNAME file exists in repository root (already present)

## Additional Notes

- The workflow runs automatically on every push to `main`
- You can also manually trigger deployments via Actions tab
- The site is built from the root directory (all files in repository root)
- No build process is required as this is a static site

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the workflow logs in the Actions tab
2. Review the DEPLOYMENT.md file for detailed instructions
3. Open an issue in the repository
